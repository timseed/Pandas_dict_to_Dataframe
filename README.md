# Pandas_dict_to_Dataframe

Please find a worked example of reading a Python Dictionary - which has a repeating field, into a Pandas Dataframe.

Due to the nature of the data - the DataFrom.from_dict() does not give me the results I want.... so instead I should you how you can achieve this easily and quickly.

This data frame can then be made a Time Series - for further data manipulation.
